The last supposed occurrence featured events no nation had been able to predict such as cookie baking and horse grooming, but that was centuries ago.\nJust today, the seers appeared once again, unseen for almost three hundred years. The Miramortem Games were announced with the date set for two months down the line. They listed off the participants, and you were included as one of many to represent your nation. No hints are given as to what the nations will be tested on come time of the event, but everyone knows that placing last will have negative consequences.\n\nAfter all, the last nation to supposedly have lost no longer exists."
